function [T] = findProjectiveTransform(pointsSet1,pointsSet2)
% Description:
% This routine calculates the Affine transform that maps points in set1 to corresponding points in set2, optimally in the least mean square sense
% Inputs:
% pointsSet1, pointsSet2 – array 2XN of coordinates of the form [x1,x2,x3…; y1, y2, y3…] representing quads
% Outputs:
% T - projective transformation matrix
