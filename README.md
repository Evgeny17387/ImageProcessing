# ImageProcessing
## Description
This repo contains homeworks done as part of the ImageProcessing course in Haifa University, Israel</br>

### HW 1
#### Qunatization

#### Binarization
Using <b>Lyod-Max Algorithm</b> for Optimal Binarization from 8 to 1 bit</br>
Optimal Binarization makes objects distinguishable from background
